						<p>
						As a first post to the really simple blog-type framework I put together, 
						here is a short outline of how it all works 
						(in case I forget as well as just for viewing by others).
						Every post gets its own HTML page, each of which reference a single 
						common stylesheet to make them all uniform in appearance. 
						All the content in a post, whether it's one paragraph or three short essays 
						and a set of images, all sits in the main ID'd div that is used for two purposes- 
						one, so a :before element can be added to make a simple header, and two 
						(not yet implemented but hopefully will be soon) so that I can replace the 
						manual thumbnails on index.html with automated thumbnails that just get the 
						first paragraph or first image of every post neatly tossed in the box.

						<p>
						Borger (/ˈbɔərdʒər/ boar-jər) is the largest city in Hutchinson County, Texas, United States. 
						The population was 13,251 at the 2010 census. Borger is named for businessman Asa Philip 
						"Ace" Borger, who also established the Hutchinson County seat of Stinnett and several 
						other small towns in Texas and Oklahoma. The first Panhandle oil well was drilled 
						in the Borger area on May 2, 1921, on the 6666 (the "Four Sixes") Ranch of S.B. Burnett. 
						The strike was of a poor quality, and later wells in Borger and Pampa spurred the 
						petroleum boom. The first rotary drilling rig, built at the then staggering price of $25,000, 
						was placed into use near Borger by W.T. Willis, J.E. Trigg, and H.D. Lewis. 
						The 6-inch-diameter (150 mm) drill could pierce through rock.
