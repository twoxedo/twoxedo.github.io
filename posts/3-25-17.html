        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        As a first post to the really simple blog-type framework I put together, here is a short outline of how it all works
        (in case I forget as well as just for viewing by others).
      </p>
      <p>
        Every post gets its own HTML page, each of which reference a single common stylesheet to make them all uniform in appearance. 
        All the content in a post, whether it's one paragraph or three short essays and a set of images, all sits in the main ID'd div that is used for two purposes-
        one, so a :before element can be added to make a simple header, and two (not yet implemented but hopefully will be soon) 
        so that I can replace the manual thumbnails on index.html with automated thumbnails that just get the first paragraph or first image 
        of every post neatly tossed in the box.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Of course, this is all really simple, and while it would be nice to use an interface like wordpress or tumblr have I'm sticking with
        my own system, mostly as a learning experience (prior to making this website I've relearned and reforgetten HTML/CSS/JS two or three times).
      </p>
      <p>
        If any actual experienced web developer ever happens to see this and wants to call me out on my not-so-good development practices, 
        there's a couple social media/contact links at the top right of the <a href="https://twoxedo.github.io">main page</a>, on the navigation bar, where you can 
        feel free to <i>roast me.</i>
      </p>
      <p> 
        Otherwise, I'm enjoying learning as I go and putting together this great little website and I hope anyone else watching is enjoying it too!
