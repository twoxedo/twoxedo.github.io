  Hey everybody. 
  While I'm working on a simple framework for blog-type updates to this site, 
  I figured I should put something other than lorem ipsum on here. 
  With that being said, here is a recent project of mine.

  <p>part 1 - model only, before I made any materials</p>

  <p>part 2 - original model + some experimental materials</p>

  <p>part 3 - second material revision, reduced noise on crate + replaced rings with square buckles</p>
